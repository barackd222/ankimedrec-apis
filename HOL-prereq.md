Installation

This sections will help you deploy the different packages required to run this Application. This includes: NodeJS, MongoDB and Git.

Note: I use Ubuntu Linux distribution, adjust accordingly if using other OS (e.g. "yum" if using Fedora based distributions).

1. Install NodeJS, MongoDB and Git.

The first step is to ensure that you have installed NodeJS, MongoDB and Git in your environment. In case you know that you have already installed them, feel free to move to step number 2. Otherwise if you are unsure, continue with the following assessment:

Validate the installation of the required components (one at a time):

nodejs --version
mongo --version
git --version
1.1 Install NodeJS (if not already installed)

sudo apt-get install curl -y
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x |
sudo -E bash â€“
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y 
Validate the NodeJS installation:

node --version
You should get a valid version. I used NodeJS version 4.8.0 while building this application.

1.2 Install MongoDB (if not already installed):

sudo apt-get install mongodb -y
Validate the MongoDB installation:

mongo --version
You should get a valid version. I used MongDB shell version 2.6.10 while building this application
